## Running the project
Open the folder as a workspace and install composer("composer install"). Rename '- Copy.env' to '.env'.
Run the project using "php artisan serve" in the terminal with directory of the folder.

## Registration & Login
You can use the following creditencials:
- email - eroval2@test.com
- password - eroval98

Or just create a user yourself. There is however no 'explore' page sharing pictures of users you AREN'T following, so you'd have to go to a user's url directly and first follow him with the number being the id of the user. There are some already setup users (assuming you are using the url format, otherwise just add /profile/1 to your url): 
- "http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/1" 
- "http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/2"
