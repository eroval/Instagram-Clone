## Supports:
- user registration & login
- following & unfollowing
- email sending
- posting system

## Registration/Login
Run the project using "php artisan serve" in the terminal with directory of the folder of the whole project using the following creditencials:
- email - eroval2@test.com
- password - eroval98

Or just create a user yourself. There is however no 'explore' page sharing pictures of users you aren't following, so you'd have to go to a user's url directly like: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/profile/1".
